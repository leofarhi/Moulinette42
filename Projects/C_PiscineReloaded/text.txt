Chapter I
Foreword
Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, for-
mer Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United
States government who copied and leaked classified information from the National Se-
curity Agency (NSA) in 2013 without authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous
global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Al-
liance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments.
In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previ-
ous employment with Dell and the CIA. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong
after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands
of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen
MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material
appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by
other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times.
On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden
of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property.
Two days later, he flew into Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, but Russian authorities
noted that his U.S. passport had been cancelled and he was restricted to the airport
terminal for over one month. Russia ultimately granted him right of asylum for one year,
and repeated extensions have permitted him to stay at least until 2020. He reportedly
lives in an undisclosed location in Moscow, and continues to seek asylum elsewhere in the
world.
A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower,
a dissident, a traitor and a patriot. His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveil-
lance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information
privacy.
